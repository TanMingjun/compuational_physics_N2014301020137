##Exercise2.6:<br>
####Problem:<br>
Use the Euler method to calculate cannon shell trajectories ignoring both air drag  
and the effect of air density(actually,ignoring the former authomatically rules out the latter).   
Compare your results with those in Figure 2.4,and with the exact solution.<br>
